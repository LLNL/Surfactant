# Usage

## Identify Sample File

In order to test out surfactant, you will need a sample file/folder. If you don't have one on hand, you can download and use the portable .zip file from https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases or the Linux .tar.gz file from https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS/releases. Alternatively, you can pick a sample from https://lc.llnl.gov/gitlab/cir-software-assurance/unpacker-to-sbom-test-files
