# Getting Started

## System Prerequisites

Surfactant requires Python 3.8 or newer. Tests are regularly run on Linux, macOS,
and Windows, though it should also work on other operating systems such as FreeBSD.

## Installation

### For Users:

For ease of use, we recommend using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) since it transparently handles creating and using Python virtual environments, which helps avoid dependency conflicts with other installed Python apps. Install `pipx` by following [their installation instructions](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#install-pipx).

1. Install Surfactant using `pipx install` (with python >= 3.8)

```bash
pipx install surfactant
```

> Note: Mach-O file support requires installing Surfactant with the `macho` optional dependencies, and Java file support requires installing with the `java` optional dependencies (e.g. `pipx install surfactant[macho,java]`).

2. Install plugins using `pipx inject surfactant`. As an example, this is how the fuzzy hashing plugin could be installed from a git repository (PyPI package names, local source directories, or wheel files can also be used).

```bash
pipx inject surfactant git+https://github.com/LLNL/Surfactant#subdirectory=plugins/fuzzyhashes
```

If for some reason manually managing virtual environments is desired, the following steps can be used instead:

1. Create a virtual environment with python >= 3.8 and activate it [Optional, but highly recommended over a global install]

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Surfactant with `pip install`

```bash
pip install surfactant
```

3. Install plugins using `pip install`. As an example, this is how the fuzzy hashing plugin could be installed from a git repository (PyPI package names, local source directories, or wheel files can also be used).

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LLNL/Surfactant#subdirectory=plugins/fuzzyhashes
```

### For Developers:

1. Create a virtual environment with python >= 3.8 [Optional, but recommended]

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Clone sbom-surfactant

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LLNL/Surfactant.git
```

3. Create an editable surfactant install (changes to code will take effect immediately):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To install optional dependencies required for running pytest and pre-commit:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test,dev]"
```

`pip install` with the `-e` or `--editable` option can also be used to install Surfactant plugins for development.

## Generating an SBOM
To create an SBOM, run the `surfactant generate` subcommand. For more details on the options it takes, please refer to this page on [basic usage](basic_usage.md). For more information on writing Surfactant configuration files for software specimens, see the documentation on how to build a [specimen configuration file](configuration_files.md#specimen-configuration-file).

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of what Surfactant does. The [internal implementation overview](internals_overview.md) page gives more detail about how Surfactant works internally.

![Surfactant Overview Diagram](img/surfactant_overview_diagram.svg)

In simpler cases such as generating an SBOM for a single file or directory that lives on the same system as Surfactant is being run on, Surfactant can just be given the path to generate the SBOM for:

```bash
surfactant generate "C:/Program Files/Adobe/Acrobat Reader" acrobat_reader_sbom.json
```

This command will generate an output SBOM file named `acrobat_reader_sbom.json` for all files in `C:/Program Files/Adobe/Acrobat Reader`, with install paths for files in the SBOM that show them as being under `C:/Program Files/Adobe/Acrobat Reader`. Alternatively, running Surfactant from the `C:/Program Files/Adobe` folder with the command `surfactant generate "Acrobat Reader" acrobat_reader_sbom.json` would result in the install paths in the SBOM showing the files as being under the relative path `Acrobat Reader/`.

If the path is to a single file an SBOM will be generated for that single file, unless its name ends in a `.json` extension (or the very rare case of the path being given to Surfactant beginning with one of 3 special prefixes: `config:`, `file:`, and `dir:`).

If an SBOM is being generated that requires more fine-grained control over various options such as the install prefix, or for capturing information on multiple locations, then Surfactant should be given a path to a [specimen configuration file](configuration_files.md#specimen-configuration-file). It is strongly recommended to always include a `.json` file extension as part of the file name.

### Special Specimen Config Argument Prefixes

For the specimen config command line argument, the path to a file with a `.json` extension is always treated as a specimen configuration file, and a path to a file without a `.json` file extension is treated as being for generating an SBOM with just that single file. To override this behavior, the specimen configuration argument to `surfactant generate` recognizes the special prefixes `config:`, `file:`, and `dir:`. For example, `surfactant generate file:home/abc.json` would tell Surfactant to generate an SBOM with a single entry in it, for the file called `abc.json` in the `home` directory (without the `file:` prefix, `home/abc.json` would be interpreted as a specimen configuration file).

Similarly, a `config:` prefix forces Surfactant to interpret the given file path as a specimen configuration file regardless of if the file name is missing a `.json` extension.

A file or directory name that starts with one of these special prefixes could cause problems, however these cases should be extremely rare and can always be solved by creating a specimen configuration file (which since it is user created, can be given a file name that avoids issues). However, a special prefix could also be used to solve the issue. For example with a directory named `config:myapp`, running `surfactant generate config:myapp` will look for a specimen configuration file called `myapp`. To resolve this, the `dir:` prefix could be added to essentially tell Surfactant "this directory is actually named config:myapp". Running `surfactant generate dir:config:myapp` would then generate an SBOM for everyting in a directory called `config:myapp`.

NOTE: As long as the directory or file name that starts with the special prefix isn't the first thing in the argument, adding a special prefix shouldn't be necessary. For example, running `surfactant generate abc/config:myapp` or `surfactant generate /etc/config:myapp` to create an SBOM from a directory or file called `config:myapp` should work without issues since the specimen config argument doesn't start with one of the special prefixes.

Surfactant specimen configuration file should never be given a name that starts with one of these special prefixes, and should always end in a `.json` file extension.

## Understanding the SBOM Output

The following is a brief overview of the default SBOM file output format (which follows the CyTRICS schema). It is
not an exhaustive guide to the SBOM format. When the schema is made publicly available a link will be included here.

### Software

This section contains a list of entries relating to each piece of software found in the sample. Metadata including file size, vendor, version, etc are included in this section along with a uuid to uniquely identify the software entry.

### Relationships

This section contains information on how each of the software entries in the previous section are linked.

**Uses**: this relationship type means that x software uses y software i.e. y is a helper module to x\
**Contains**: this relationship type means that x software contains y software (often x software is an installer or archive such as a zip file)

### Star Relationships

This section contains information on how analysis data or observation entries are related/linked to software (or hardware) entries.

### Observations

This section contains observations, typically related to CVEs that impact a piece of software.

### Analysis Data

This section is for listing files that are output by plugins/analysis tools.

### Hardware

This section contains information on hardware, ranging from a fairly high-level down to individual components on a PCB.
Surfactant does not currently populate this section, it is either filled in manually or using other tools that are aimed
at analyzing based on pictures of circuit boards.

### System

This section contains information on the overall system that software and hardware entries are a part of. Typically
it will be manually added to an SBOM that has been generated by Surfactant, though the merge command can also be
given an option to generate a system entry.
