def establish_relationships(
    sbom: SBOM, software: Software, metadata
) -> Optional[List[Relationship]]:
    """
    Establish `Uses` relationships between a software item and its ELF-declared
    dependencies.

    This function resolves dependencies listed in `metadata["elfDependencies"]`
    by computing the set of possible runtime file paths for each dependency and
    attempting to match them against software entries in the SBOM. Resolution
    proceeds in two stages:

        1. **fs_tree-based lookup**
           Fully-qualified dependency paths (absolute or constructed from
           runpaths, RPATH, RUNPATH, and $ORIGIN substitutions) are checked
           against the SBOM filesystem graph. This lookup is symlink-aware and
           can resolve through both real and synthetic alias relationships
           captured during SBOM generation.

        2. **Legacy installPath fallback**
           If no fs_tree match is found, the function falls back to a strict
           legacy rule: a candidate software entry must advertise the same
           filename *and* must contain an exact installPath equal to one of the
           computed dependency paths.

    No heuristic directory-level inference is performed. Dependencies are only
    matched when the SBOM contains a resolvable path or an exact legacy
    installPath entry.

    Args:
        sbom (SBOM): The software bill of materials containing all discovered
            software entries and the filesystem graph.
        software (Software): The software entry whose dependencies are being
            resolved.
        metadata: Metadata extracted from the ELF file. Must contain the
            `"elfDependencies"` field to participate in relationship inference.

    Returns:
        Optional[List[Relationship]]:
            A list of `Relationship(dependent, dependency, "Uses")` entries.
            Returns `None` if the metadata does not contain `elfDependencies`.

    Notes:
        - Dependency paths may originate from:
            • absolute paths in metadata
            • relative paths joined against each installPath
            • computed runpaths (RPATH/RUNPATH) and default library paths
        - Duplicate relationships are suppressed.
        - Self-dependencies are not emitted.

    Example:
        relationships = establish_relationships(sbom, software, metadata)
        for rel in relationships or []:
            print(f"{rel.xUUID} uses {rel.yUUID}")

    #   • Absolute paths, e.g. "/opt/lib/libbar.so"
    #
    # The dynamic loader interprets these differently, and the resolution logic
    # below mirrors that behavior. We normalize each dependency into candidate
    # full paths ("fpaths") that represent where the loader *could* reasonably
    # locate the referenced library within the captured filesystem snapshot.
    #
    # Notes:
    #   - posix_normpath() removes "..", ".", and duplicate separators to keep
    #     path comparisons consistent with fs_tree key normalization.
    #   - No directory inference or fuzzy matching occurs: all candidate paths
    #     must be derived strictly from ELF semantics (slashes vs. bare names)

        #
        #   Case 1: The string contains a slash (e.g., "somedir/libfoo.so")
        #           → The dynamic loader interprets this as a literal path.
        #             - If absolute, the path is used directly.
        #             - If relative, it is resolved relative to each installPath
        #               of the referencing software. This mirrors runtime behavior
        #               where a DT_NEEDED entry containing "subdir/libX.so" is
        #               interpreted relative to the binary's directory.
        #
        #   Case 2: Bare filename (e.g., "libfoo.so")
        #           → The loader searches a sequence of directories:
        #             runpaths, rpaths, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, cache entries,

        #   - Hash-equivalent copies of files (created during extraction or
        #     symlink flattening) are also captured by fs_tree and can lead to

    This function determines the appropriate runpath entries by analyzing

    dynamic string tokens (DSTs) to produce formatted paths.

    Token behavior summary:
        $ORIGIN / ${ORIGIN}:
            Replaced with the absolute directory containing the program or shared object
            (with symlinks resolved and no ../ or ./ components).
            For SUID/SGID binaries, the resolved path must lie in a trusted directory.
            References:
              - glibc: elf/dl-load.c#L356-L357
              - glibc: elf/dl-load.c#L297-L316

        $LIB / ${LIB}:
            Expands to either "lib" or "lib64" depending on architecture
            (e.g. x86-64 → lib64, x86-32 → lib).

        $PLATFORM / ${PLATFORM}:
            Expands to the CPU type string (e.g. "x86_64").
            On some architectures this comes from AT_PLATFORM in the auxiliary vector.
            Implementing full substitution would require target-specific enumeration
            of possible platform values (from glibc or musl sources), which is nontrivial
            and rarely used — similar to hardware capability (hwcaps) subfolder searching.
            For now, such paths are discarded if unresolved.

    If no DSTs are present, the original path is returned unchanged.

    Parameters:
        sw (Software): The software object (used for $ORIGIN resolution).
        md (dict): ELF metadata.
        path (str): The raw path string to process.

    Returns:
        List[pathlib.PurePosixPath]: All normalized, substituted search paths.
