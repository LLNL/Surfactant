    object to be included as part of the metadata field, and potentially used as part of

    anything to the Software entry metadata.

    Args:
        sbom (SBOM): The SBOM that the software entry is part of. Can be used to add observations or analysis data.
        software (Software): The software entry the gathered information will be added to.
        filename (str): The full path to the file to extract information from.
        filetype (str): File type information based on magic bytes.
        context_queue (Queue[ContextEntry]): Modifiable queue of entries typically initialized from the input specimen
            config file. Plugins can add new entries to the queue to make Surfactant process additional files/folders.
            Existing plugins should still work without adding this parameter.
        current_context (Optional[ContextEntry]): The ContextEntry object from the queue whose files are currently being
            processed (modifying it is considered undefined behavior and should be avoided). Most plugins do not need to
            use this parameter.
        children (List[Software]): List of additional software entries to include in the SBOM. Plugins can add
            additional entries, though if the plugin extracts files to a temporary directory, the context argument
            should be used to have Surfactant process the files instead.
        software_field_hints (List[tuple[str, str]]): List of tuples containing the name of a software entry field,
            a suggested value for it, and a confidence level. Plugins can use this information to suggest values for
            software entry fields by adding entries to this list. The one with the highest confidence level for a
            field will be selected.
        omit_unrecognized_types (bool): Whether files with types that are not recognized by Surfactant should be
            left out of the SBOM. When a plugin is adding additional context entries to the queue, it should typically
            default to propagating this value to the new context entries that it creates.

    Returns:
        object: An object to be added to the metadata field for the software entry. May be `None` to add no metadata.
